This arrangement allows us to provide you with professional-grade AI solutions while maintaining the technical expertise and infrastructure required for optimal performance.

### 1.3 Service Availability
We strive to provide reliable and consistent service availability. However, we do not guarantee uninterrupted access to our services, as they may be affected by factors beyond our control, including but not limited to technical issues, maintenance, or third-party service disruptions.

## 2. User Responsibilities and Obligations

### 3.2 Service Deactivation upon Non-Payment
**Critical Notice**: If you fail to make payments for our services, NexusCore AI reserves the right to deactivate your AI automation service.
